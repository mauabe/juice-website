# juice-website

This is an exercise to create a website using plain HTML/CSS/Javascript from a Photoshop PSD file.

The first thing I've noticed is how hooked I am in using templates, CMS, snippets or external libraries such as Bootstrap and Materialize CSS, or other frameworks like React. I really enjoyed building the site in HTML and trying to make it pretty with CSS. It is like 1999 all over again.

I didn't have time to do a lot of the funcionality of the site, such as the drop-down menus the image slider or the carousel. 

And what is probaly very noticeable, the CSS needs a lot of work. One "mistake" I made was trying to get everything working all at once. So I got  a few things here and there, while lots of other parts are just completely out of place. If I had to re-do it again, I would just put place-holders and work on one section at a time. 

I am not used to have my code inspected. I guess that is a flaw in my development. I usually just get the site working and the client happy, I could use a bit of "best practices" review. I think of myself as the wolf-boy who grew up in the jungle and knows little about the rules of society. Living and learning.
